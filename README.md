I'm a Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer with over 7 years of experience in creating intelligent, data-driven solutions. I've had the opportunity to work across various sectors like automotive, finance, and IT consulting.

I have a passion for problem-solving and pioneering first-principle thinking, driven by purpose and fueled by the challenge of finding solutions, with a strong foundation in Python, Computer Vision, NlP, Spark, AWS, etc. I've led diverse tech teams covering Machine Learning and ML-Ops and building scalable products from scratch with the commitment to making a positive impact through technology.

I'm an explorer of new tech, an avid learner, and a problem-solver at heart. When I'm not in code, you'll find me watching tech-related videos, fueling my curiosity.

Feel free to connect with me for all things tech or just to say hello! Let's shape the future of tech together. 🌟
